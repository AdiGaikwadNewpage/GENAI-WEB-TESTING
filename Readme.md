## 🚀 Project Overview

SDET-GENIE is a cutting-edge, AI-powered Quality Assurance (QA) automation framework that revolutionizes the software testing process. Leveraging advanced AI agents, SDET - GENIE transforms user stories directly into comprehensive, executable test automation code.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered QA Agent

- Converts user stories into detailed Gherkin scenarios
- Generates both positive and negative test cases
- Covers various user flows and edge conditions

### 2. Intelligent Browser Agent

- Automated browser interaction and test execution
- Dynamic element identification and mapping
- Comprehensive DOM detail capture
- Robust element selector generation

### 3. Code Generation Agent

- Produces production-ready automation code
- Supports multiple testing frameworks
- Adaptive to different application architectures

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- Python
- AI Models (OpenAI gpt-4o-mini)
- Selenium/Playwright
- Gherkin/Cucumber
- Browser Automation Technologies

## 🌈 Acknowledgments

- Inspired by the challenges in modern software quality assurance
- Powered by cutting-edge AI technologies

## How it works:

```
1 - Entrypoint: User story about what to do in the website.
2 - prompt = generate_gherkin_scenarios(user_story)

3 - With browser context.


4 - Parse Gherkin scenarios.

5 - Execute each Gherkin scenario:
    - Start Browser with custom actions registered:
        Custom actions registered:
        -> "Get XPath of element using index"
        -> "Get element property"
        -> "Perform element action"

    # Execute and collect results
    history = await browser_agent.run()

6 - From browser history:
    -> Collect XPaths.
    -> Collect actions.
    -> Collect extracted content.

    # Combined history:
    # Save combined history to session state
    st.session_state.history = {
        "urls": history.urls(),
        "action_names": history.action_names(),
        "detailed_actions": all_actions,
        "element_xpaths": element_xpath_map,
        "extracted_content": all_extracted_content,
        "errors": history.errors(),
        "model_actions": history.model_actions(),
        "execution_date": st.session_state.get("execution_date", "Unknown")
    }

7 - Code generation:
    automation_code = generator_function(
        generated_steps,  # Generated Gherkin scenarios.
        history
    )
```
## 📝 Changelog
### Version 1.1.0 (19-03-2025) New Features:
- Editable Gherkin Scenarios : Users can now edit the AI-generated Gherkin scenarios directly in the application
- Save Changes Button : Added functionality to save edited scenarios with visual confirmation
- Persistent Scenarios : Saved scenarios remain visible in the UI until explicitly changed
- Execution Flow Improvement : Users must save changes before executing steps (with warning if unsaved changes exist)
- Code Generation Enhancement : Generated code now uses the edited scenarios instead of the original AI-generated ones
- UI Improvements : Simplified color scheme with sky blue theme for better readability Workflow Changes:
    1. Generate Gherkin scenarios from user story
    2. Edit scenarios if needed
    3. Click "Save Changes" button (required even if no edits were made)
    4. Click "Execute Steps" to run the saved scenarios
    5. Generate code based on the executed scenarios and browser history
